[**CVE ID Allocation Service (CVE-IAS)**](https://github.com/CVEProject/CVE-ID-Allocation-Service)
working group notes























# Agenda/Next steps/Action Items
* Refine & Define attributes/actions

  _[11/15] itital discussion; fields need to be reconciled with existing state definitions. Privacy fields should be wrapped into state_
* Continue to expand "customer" Scenarios
* Discuss backend/administrative scenarios
* ~~Confirm agreement on the draft "Object Model"~~ [Completed 11/15]

  _[11/15] General agreement on the approach; details are still required_

# (Draft) "Object model"
## CVE attributes
* ID
* Status

  | Values | Definition | 
  | ---- | --- | 
  | Free | (is this needed?) | 
  | Rejected | {{Schmitty: Follow up with documentation}} https://cve.mitre.org/about/faqs.html#reject_signify_in_cve_entry  | 
  | Disputed | (CVE content) | 
  | Populated | (All details/fields are provide) | 
  | Published | (Someone has published a document referencing the CVE) | 
  | Public | {{Schmitty: Follow up with documentation}} | 
  | Reserved | {{Schmitty: Follow up with documentation}} | 
  | Obsolete | (?) | 
  | (others?) |  | 

* Requestor (user)
* Organization
  
  _Company or group the requestor is/was affiliated with **at the time of the request**_

  this may be duplicative IFF another service can give me a point in time value for the org.}
* ~~Privacy~~ _[11/15] recommend providing this info via status_
  * ~~Public~~
  * ~~Private~~
  * ~~Other~~
* History (Event & Timestamp)
  * CVE Creation
* Status change

## CVE Actions:
| Action | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Get | Provides status and additional metadata/information |
| Request | allocates a CVE and assigns ownership to the requestor |
| Free | deallocates a CVE (returning the CVEs to the queue) |





# Use cases/scenarios
## Scenarios to support:
* A user (or organization) wants to request a small/medium block of CVEs and use them throughout the  month/quarter. They manage their own allocated (but unused) CVEs using them as needed and refresh their collection of CVEs as needed
  Note: This is essentially a more automated variation of the current state, but still has the benefit of allowing Users/Orgs to leverage smaller block sizes and make requests automatically
* A user (or organization) does not have the capability or desire to manage a large block of CVEs. Instead they perform just-in-time requests to assure they request only the number of CVEs needed. IFF an unnecessary CVE is requested they immediately return the CVE to the pool.
  Note: This is particularly beneficial for end-user who do not want to invest in preserving state
* A user (or organization) performs 'best-effort' just-in-time requests, but often pulls more CVEs than they need. Instead of returning the spare CVEs or building a system to manage them the next time they need a CVE they query CVE-IAS for CVEs assigned to them with a status 'Free'. The Free CVEs are used and new IDs are requested as needed.
* Use Case: Vuln flow
  1. Vulnerability reported
  2. Repro/verification confirms a CVE is necessary
  3. Once confirmed automaton is triggered to request a new CVE from CVE-IAS
  4. After collecting the required information the vulnerability, CVE, etc. are presented publically and published to the GitHub CVE repository
* A user (or organization) wants to periodically reviews/audits the requests made to CVE-IAS

  (Are all CVEs accounted for? Are there any Extra CVEs? Mismatches?)
  
### [For discussion]
* List CVE's assigned to me (and their status)
* Audit history/timeline of CVE (e.g. Status changes, Request date, etc.)
* Returning/deallocating unused CVEs
* Portal & API access
* Support for CVE request to come from org/automation/service accounts
  (as opposed to an individual user)
* (?) Request CVEs with a specific year suffix
  {should year still be a factor in the CVE ID?}
* Do we want to be able to request CVE by year?




# Parking lot/follow-up topics
## Quotas:
* Any objections to the hard limit?
* What is the best way to tune hard/soft limits?
* Should notifications/alerts be sent when a requestor approaches a quota limits?
* Managing quotas (how do I request a quota expansion)

## Portal/Web interface
* What personas/scenarios do we expect the Web UI to address
  (Low volume requests? Auditing/history functions for CVE Requestors? Backend data analysis by MITRE? Public queries?)
* Presumably it should be able to answer the questions: "How many CVE's have I requested? When? Status?"
* Can the portal help me detect abuse on my account?

# Dependencies
Authorization working group
Current assumption/expectation is that the Authorization working group will address fundamental questions:
* How will we perform credentialing?
* What Credential Service Provider(s) will be used?
  (Ideally multiple authentication mechanism will be supported -- e.g. FB, Google, MSA, etc.)


## CVE User Registration
Current assumption/expectation is that the CVE User Registration will provide fundamental functionality
* With whom are they affiliated (i.e. company, organization, etc.)?
* What are they allowed to do? What are they allowed to view? (RBAC)
Note: Requirements from the CVE-IAS will need to be collect to drive the right technology decision within the CVE User Registration project.

## Submission service
The Submission service will serve to augment and manage information published to GitHub and may be able to support/automate the proposed CVE's status tracking (return from the Get action)


# Administrivia
## Objectives:
* Identifying key scenarios ("How will this service be used?")
* Collect requirements (functional and technical )
* Identify dependencies/blockers
  
## Out of Scope
* AuthN/Credential Solution Provide -- CVE-IAS will take a dependency on CVE-UR to supply this functionality

## Future steps:
* Identify roles and responsibilities
  (Will MITRE supply infrastructure? Who will contribute to development? How?)
* Sample Code -- we will want to provide a reference implementation so that smaller groups will be able to use this technology without making a huge investment in starting from scratch.
